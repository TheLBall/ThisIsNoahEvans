# Hello!
## I'm Noah Evans, a developer and the Founder of [Velocity Apps](https://velocityapps.tech).

## What do I do?
Way too many things.
I spend my free time making iOS and macOS apps, as well as Python programs. I seem to have a reputation of being the *'Twitter Bot Man'*, as I used to run many Twitter bots.
I'm currently learning Swift, and have a good understanding of Python and HTML.

## What am I working on now?
**Currently, I'm working on...**
* [What's Cooking](https://velocityapps.tech/whatscooking) - an app to help you decide what to eat
* IdeaPacket - more info soon...

## Want to contact me?
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/thisisnoahevans) is probably the best way to contact me, but you can also send me an [email](mailto:github@itsnoahevans.co.uk).
